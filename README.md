You can try app by loadin Project1.exe file for check how it works. There is a math model of Hopfield Network with a simple UI which can:
1) Resize size of the network with the sidebar on the top
2) Make Random array and corrupt current state (for checking how Neural Network works
3) Inverse button for inversing current image
4) clear what on screen
5) capture image and show it (just for storing images)
6) Learn current image - neural network taking image as a input and remember this image and clearing the board
7) clear NET - for init state of neural network (forget all images)
8) Recognition - after neural network have been taught, you can input similar image on the board and neural network will try to recreate it
9) animation - type how many steps you want network to iterate through states. (works if checkbox Asynchronous enabled )
10) ...
