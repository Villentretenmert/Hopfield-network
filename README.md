To try the app, load the Project1.exe file and see how it works. It includes a math model of the Hopfield Network with a simple UI that can:

1) Resize the size of the network using the sidebar at the top
2) Create a random array and corrupt the current state (for checking how the neural network works)
3) Inverse the current image
4) Clear the screen
5) Capture an image and display it (just for storing images)
6) Learn the current image: the neural network takes the image as input and remembers it, clearing the board
7) Clear the NET: reset the state of the neural network (forget all images)
8) Recognition: after the neural network has been taught, you can input a similar image on the board, and the neural network will try to recreate it
9) Animation: type how many steps you want the network to iterate through states (works if the Asynchronous checkbox is enabled)
